Students will learn how to customize their game with near endless possible combinations: Are you a UFO collecting cows? Or a kid eating up their favorite foods and avoiding their least favorites? Or a ninja nabbing fruit and not the bombs? Their games will feature a point system, and students will code in-game items such that they gain or lose points when the player clicks on them. This course will not only strengthen studentsâ€™ coding skills, but also their keyboard and mouse skills. Throughout the course, students will earn physical badges that demonstrate their mastery and inspire them to keep coding!"

In our Winter program, students at La Jolla Elementary will learn a powerful programming language for designing and customizing beautiful interactive worlds that they can walk (or fly!) through. Beginners will be surprised to find that with just a few lines of code, they are able to create places that have never existed before. Advanced students will be pleasantly surprised at how deep and subtle the art of world-building really is. In this session, students will continue to earn badges as they become more and more fluent in coding."
